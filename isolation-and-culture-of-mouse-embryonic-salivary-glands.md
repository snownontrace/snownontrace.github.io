1. Materials
	- Timed pregnant mice at E13-E13.5 for isolating embryonic salivary glands
	- 70% ethanol spray bottle
	- Standard forceps (e.g. Fine Science Tools, 11000-12)
	- Fine sharp scissors (Fine Science Tools, 14060-10)
	- DMEM/F-12 (e.g., Thermo Fisher, 11039047)
	- 100x PenStrep (10,000 units/mL penicillin, 10,000 µg/mL streptomycin; e.g., Thermo Fisher, 15140163)
	- DMEM/F-12 + 1x PenStrep (referred to as "__medium__" throughout this protocol): add 5 mL 100x PenStrep to 500 mL DMEM/F-12
	- Dissecting microscope (e.g., Leica M80; any common dissecting microscopes should work)
	- Dumont \#5 forceps (Fine Science Tools, 11251-20)
	- Dumont \#5 fine forceps (Fine Science Tools, 11254-20)
	- Scalpel (Fine Science Tools, 10011-00 and 10003-12)
	- 10-cm dish (e.g., Corning 430167)
	- 35-mm dish (e.g., Corning, 430165)
	- Polycarbonate filter, 13 mm diameter 0.1 µm pore size (MilliporeSigma, WHA110405)
	- MatTek dish (MatTek, P50G-1.5-14-F)

1. Isolate the string of embryos from timed pregnant mice.
	- Euthanize the timed pregnant mouse (or mice) at E13-E13.5 by CO<sub>2</sub> following standard operating procedures of your animal facility.
	- With the ventral side up, the euthanized mouse was sprayed with 70% ethanol around the abdomen.
	- Use the standard forceps to grab and pull the skin towards the bottom, and then make a horizontal cut with fine sharp scissors.
	- Next, cut upwards along the midline of the abdomen to expose the abdominal cavity.
	- The string of embryos should be easily visible. While using forceps to grab between embryos and pull up the string, use scissors to cut off the 3 connections (cervix, left and right ovaries).
	- Put the string of embryos in ~10 mL medium in a 10-cm dish.

1. Dissect out embryos from the uterus tube (the string of embryos) in the 10-cm dish.
	- From one end of the string, use one pair of Dumont #5 forceps to pierce through the uterus membrane between the last and the second to the last embryos, and use another pair to tear the uterus membrane and squeeze out the embryo. The embryo is still inside the amniotic sac.
	- Use one pair of Dumont #5 forceps to pierce through the amniotic membrane surrounding the embryo, and use another pair to tear the amniotic membrane to release the embryo.
	- Repeat these steps to release all embryos.

1. 
Mouse submandibular salivary glands were isolated at embryonic day 12 or 13 (E12 or E13) as previously described (Sequeira et al., 2013). Briefly, a scalpel (Fine Science Tools, 10011-00 and 10003-12) was used to decapitate the mouse embryo. While the detached head was held on its side with one prong of forceps (Fine Science Tools, 11251-20) pierced through the top, a scalpel was used to slice across the mouth opening to isolate the mandible and tongue, between which the submandibular glands were sandwiched. Under a dissecting microscope, the detached mandible tissue was placed on a glass plate with the tongue facing down. A pair of forceps was used to slice through the midline of the mandible tissue to expose the tongue and the two submandibular glands attached to the base of the tongue. After surrounding tissues were removed, glands were detached using forceps and collected into a 35-mm dish with 3 mL DMEM/F-12 (Thermo Fisher, 11039047) medium until all embryos were dissected. Isolated salivary glands were cultured on 13 mm diameter 0.1 mm pore polycarbonate filters (MilliporeSigma, WHA110405) floating on 200 mL Organ Culture Medium in the glass bottom area of a 50 mm MatTek dish (MatTek, P50G-1.5-14-F) at 37?C with 5% CO2. Organ Culture Medium was DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 150 mg/mL vitamin C (MilliporeSigma, A7506), 50 mg/mL transferrin (MilliporeSigma, T8158) and 1 3 PenStrep (100 units/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin; Thermo Fisher, 15140163).

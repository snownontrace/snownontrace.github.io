- Wash single buds isolated by trituration by rinsing sequentially in ~150 µL media in a spot plate.
- Prepare viruses. Mixing ratio 2:1 (longer collagen IV 2 parts with smaller Rab/Strep 1 parts).
- For each bud in 5 µL media, treat with 15 µL virus mix + polybrene.
* 10 buds treated with LV-222 + 254; 5 buds each for the other 2 groups.
* In retrospect, I realized I used a little too much polybrene (intended final 1:2 dilution, but it is 3:4, so I used 1.5x of what I typically use).
- Treatment was done for 1.5 hours (~2:30 PM to 4 PM) at 37 C.
- Towards the end of virus incubation, prepare 2x Matrigel and growth factor treatment mix. 50 µL is needed per well, so I need 1 mL total.
Component			Volume for 500 µL	Volume for 1 mL
DMEM/F12			430 µL			860 µL
FGF7 (20 µg/mL)		10 µL			20 µL
ITS-G (100x)			10 µL			20 µL
Matrigel (~10 mg/mL)		50 µL			100 µL
-  After virus treatment, wash the virus off sequentially in 100 µL media and finally transfer into 47 µL media with 3 µL carryover volume (for a final volume of 50 µL).
- Aliquot 50 µL 2x treatment mix prepared above to each well.
- Incubate at 37 C with 5% CO2.

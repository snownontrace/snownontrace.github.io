1. Materials
	- Timed pregnant mice at E13-E13.5 for isolating embryonic salivary glands
	- DMEM/F-12 (e.g., Thermo Fisher, 11039047)
	- 100x PenStrep (10,000 units/mL penicillin, 10,000 µg/mL streptomycin; e.g., Thermo Fisher, 15140163)
	- DMEM/F-12 + 1x PenStrep (referred to as "__medium__" throughout this protocol): add 5 mL 100x PenStrep to 500 mL DMEM/F-12
	- Pyrex spot plate (Fisher Scientific 13-748B)
	- Dumont \#5 Fine Forceps (Fine Science Tools, 11254-20)
	- Dispase (Thermo Fisher, 17105041; diluted in DMEM/F-12)
	- 5% BSA (MilliporeSigma, A8577; diluted in DMEM/F-12)
	- Polybrene (4 mg/mL in water; Millipore- Sigma, H9268)
	- 20 µg/mL FGF7 (R&D Systems, 5028-KG-025)
	- 100x ITS supplement (Thermo Fisher, 41400045)
	- Growth factor-reduced Matrigel (Corning, 356231; stock is usually 9-10 mg/mL)
	- Ultra-low attachment 96-well V-bottom plate (S-bio, MS-9096VZ)

1. Please follow
- Treat SMGs with 2.5 units/mL dispase II in media (DMEM/F12 + P/S) for 15 min at 37 C.
- Following dispase treatment, replace dispase solution with 5% BSA in media for twice to quench dispase activity.
- Isolate single epithelial buds by trituration using low-retention tips (P200 set at 100 µL).
- Rinse buds twice by transferring them sequentially in new wells with ~150 µL 5% BSA in media.


Up to 6 intact salivary glands (see Salivary gland isolation and culture) were treated with 150 mL 2 units/mL dispase (Thermo Fisher, 17105041; diluted in DMEM/F-12) in a well of a Pyrex spot plate (Fisher Scientific 13-748B) for 15 min at 37°C. The glands were washed twice with 5% BSA (MilliporeSigma, A8577; diluted in DMEM/F-12) in the same well to quench the dispase activity. The mesenchyme of each gland was removed using a pair of forceps (Fine Science Tools, 11254-20) and a tungsten needle (Fine Science Tools, 10130-05 and 26016-12) under a dissecting microscope. The forceps were mostly used to hold the gland still, whereas the needle was gently inserted between the mesenchyme and epithelium to separate them. Isolated epithelial rudiments were transferred to a new well of the spot plate with 150 mL DMEM/F-12 medium using low-retention pipette tips (cut for larger opening; Rainin, 30389190). When needed, a pair of forceps was used to cut off single epithelial buds from the isolated epithelial rudiments.

A glycerol stock of bacteria is both great for long-term storage and very convenient to recover.

### 1. Freezing down bacteria for cryopreservation

1. Pipette 0.5 mL overnight culture of bacteria containing the desired plasmid into a sterile 1.5 or 2 mL tube.

    - We usually use the [2 mL cryogenic vial](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/fisherbrand-externally-internally-threaded-cryogenic-storage-vials-10/12567501), but in practice any sterile tube works since the vial is for -80°C storage rather than liquid N<sub>2</sub> storage.

1. Add 0.5 mL 50% glycerol (by volume) to the vial. Mix by inverting for a few times.

    - To make 50% glycerol, pour sticky 100% glycerol into a 50 mL tube to ~20 mL mark. Add equal volume of water by pipetting. Rotate the tube until the solution is homogenous. Filter sterilize.

1. Store in -80°C.


### 2. Streaking bacteria from frozen stock

1. Warm up a selection plate to room temperature.

1. Take out the frozen stock from -80°C onto a box of dry ice to prevent it from thawing.

1. Poke a sterile 1 mL pipette tip into the glycerol stock and streak attached bacteria onto the selection plate by drawing zigzag on the plate for a few turns. Restrict the drawing within half of the plate.

    - To avoid scratching the plate, place the tip at an angle to the plate and draw lightly.

1. Use a new sterile 1 mL pipette tip to draw zigzag out from previously drawn lines into untouched area of the plate.

    - The first round of drawing usually have too many bacteria so it will unlikely to grow single colonies. This second round of drawing aims to spread a tiny amount of bacteria by touching previous lines to get single colonies.

1. Incubate the plate at 37°C overnight or 30°C for 24 hours (for plasmids with high risk of recombination such as lentiviral vectors).

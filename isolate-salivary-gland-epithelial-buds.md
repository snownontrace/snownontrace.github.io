[ To Clean Up ]

Up to 6 intact salivary glands (see Salivary gland isolation and culture) were treated with 150 mL 2 units/mL dispase (Thermo Fisher, 17105041; diluted in DMEM/F-12) in a well of a Pyrex spot plate (Fisher Scientific 13-748B) for 15 min at 37?C. The glands were washed twice with 5% BSA (MilliporeSigma, A8577; diluted in DMEM/F-12) in the same well to quench the dispase activity. The mesenchyme of each gland was removed using a pair of forceps (Fine Science Tools, 11254-20) and a tungsten needle (Fine Science Tools, 10130-05 and 26016-12) under a dissecting microscope. The forceps were mostly used to hold the gland still, whereas the needle was gently inserted between the mesenchyme and epithelium to separate them. Isolated epithelial rudiments were transferred to a new well of the spot plate with 150 mL DMEM/F-12 medium using low-retention pipette tips (cut for larger opening; Rainin, 30389190). When needed, a pair of forceps was used to cut off single epithelial buds from the isolated epithelial rudiments.

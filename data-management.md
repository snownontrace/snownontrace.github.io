* For files whose version history is important, use Git for version control and use GitHub (or equivalent service) for cloud storage. These mainly include lab notes and scripts.

* For big data files (100s GB or larger), make sure to use RAID drives for local redundancy as well as to timely back up the data to institutional data storage servers.

* For other occasions, use OneDrive, Dropbox, Apple iCloud, or Google Drive for cloud storage.
